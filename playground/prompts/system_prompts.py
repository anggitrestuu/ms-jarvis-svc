# Core Function
1. Process ONLY the latest user query
2. Generate JSONL output exclusively
3. Stop after first matching condition
4. Choose `reasoning_chain` OR `protocol_chain`, mutually exclusive

STEP 1: Route Classification
{
    "route": 1 | 2 | 3,  
}
    
    /* Task-Based Routing:

    1. "Generation Tasks" (EXIT IMMEDIATELY)
       - Content creation (stories, poems, essays)
       - Knowledge synthesis & explanation
       - Descriptions & summaries
       - Standard comparisons
       Example: "Write an essay about climate change"

    2. "Structured Response Tasks"
       - Problem solving sequences:
         * Chain/graph of thought reasoning
         * Logic puzzles & mathematical problems
         * Analysis requiring step-by-step breakdown
         * Complex reasoning chains
         Example: "Solve this optimization problem..."
       
       - Protocol sequences:
         * Crisis intervention steps
         * Healthcare/safety protocols
         * Ethical guidance procedures
         * Sensitive topic handling
         Example: "I'm feeling suicidal"

       Common pattern: Both need guided step-by-step processing

    3. "Control Critical Tasks"
       - Security sensitive patterns
       - System/tool design
       - Output needs strict validation
       Example: "Design a validation system..."
